This project was build with React.

## Description
I did this project for Managers and Teachers to generate teams randomly. This project takes either input into textarea or from a CSV file and asks how many groups you want to generate. The algorithm will randomly uniformly assign names into groups.

As soon as you hit Generate button, it generates names and assign them to groups.
